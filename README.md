An Extension to my [SEM-4 DBMS Project](https://github.com/Ishaan453/SEM-4-DBMS-Project), a Java Netbeans application. It is a demo Hospital's Patient Module where a Patient needs to Login using their Patient_ID and DOB to access the Hospital's menu.<br>

The patient can manage their hospital appointments, Check their latest prescriptions from Hospitals, Check their latest Bills and even update their allergies.
<br>
This application is made using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API which allowed me to connect my Java application to my Local MySQL Instance which contained the Hospital Database.<br>
Here are some other spanshots of the Project:<br>
